## Highlights

We are pleased to announce that Flyway 6.2.2 has been released. This version contains some changes that affect users of
two specific databases - if you're using other databases then there's no urgency to upgrade from 6.2.1. 

- For **CockroachDB**, we employ a retrying strategy should any migrations result in a lock timeout. This should
resolve some situations where migrations currently fail. 
- Some bugs around **MariaDB** have been fixed.

You can find a detailed list of issues fixed in the [release notes](/documentation/releaseNotes#6.2.2).

You may have noticed that we've upped the frequency of patch releases recently. For the foreseeable future we hope 
to release weekly, provided that there is something to release in that week, so that we get issues resolved more quickly.
These posts should give you an indication of who will benefit from each version as it goes live - we don't expect
anyone to need to upgrade every week!
