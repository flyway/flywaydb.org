    <p>One evening of late 2009, Christian and I were cycling through Munich. We were chatting away about deployment
        automation. And then he suddenly he gave me the insight: <strong>database changes</strong> really should
        be deployed together with the application and <strong>executed on startup</strong>, so you never have to worry
        about them being out of sync ever again! And suddenly it all started to make sense! The seed was planted...</p>

    <p>The idea grew and soon enough I had the first code working on personal projects. It felt great! It was simple,
        and still primitive, but already I could feel it solve a real problem that would made my life as a developer
        measurably better. It was a new level of comfort. And I was not willing to give it up!</p>

    <p>When I took on my next consulting engagement, surely enough database schema upgrades had been a big thorn in the
        side of the team for ages. And so, it was time to step up and do something about it!</p>

    <p>I extracted the code from my personal project and started refactoring. It evolved quickly. Next to the existing
        MySQL support, I added the necessary Oracle support. It was looking good. All that was needed now was a name and
        a home.</p>

    <p><strong>The quest for a name wasn't easy</strong>. I brainstormed long and hard, and finally it hit me! I turned
        to nature and one of the greatest shows on earth for answers: <strong>bird migration</strong>. All over the
        world migratory birds fly reliably over enormous distances, often crossing continents and entire oceans.
        This project
        would be named in honor their flight path: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyway">Flyway</a>!</p>

    <p>And so exactly three years ago, on the 20th of April 2010, I
        registered the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flyway">Google Code project</a>, created a Mercurial repository
        and uploaded the first version.
        <a href="/documentation/learnmore/releaseNotes#0.0.1">Flyway 0.0.1</a> was born!<br/> (And yes, the <a
                href="https://code.google.com/p/flyway/downloads/detail?name=flyway-core-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar">sources</a>
        are still available :-) )</p>

    <p>The project has evolved tremendously since then! In these three years, support has been
        added for <a href="/documentation/database">7 more DBMSes</a>, a <a href="/documentation/usage/maven">Maven plugin</a>,
        <a href="/documentation/ant">Ant tasks</a>, a <a href="/documentation/usage/commandline">Command-line tool</a> and
        much more. The code moved to <a href="http://github.com/flyway/flyway">Github</a> and the website to Jekyll and
        <a href="http://github.com/flyway/flywaydb.org">Github pages</a>. There is a dedicated <a
                href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flyway">StackOverflow tag</a> and a <a
                href="https://twitter.com/flywaydb">Twitter account</a>.</p>

    <p>And the adoption has been tremendous! The project <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=flyway">ranks #1 on
        Google</a> worldwide. It has been blessed by a large number of <a href="/documentation/contribute/hallOfFame">fabulous
        contributors</a> and an <a href="https://twitter.com/FlywayDb/status/287980246752428033">astonishing number of
        users</a>.</p>

    <p>I am humbled.</p>
