    <p>The Flyway 3.x series started <a href="/blog/flyway-3.0-android.html">just under a year ago</a>.
        And <a href="/blog/thoughtworks-technology-radar.html">what</a> <a href="/blog/flyway-3.1.html">a ride</a> <a
                href="/blog/2014-review.html">it's been</a>!</p>

    <p>So without further ado, please welcome <strong>Flyway 3.2</strong>! The <strong>hightlights</strong> of this
        release are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Many improvements to the command-line tool</li>
        <li>solidDB support</li>
        <li>Improved JavaBean-style configuration</li>
        <li>Follow blog by email</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Many improvements to the command-line tool</h2>

    <p>The first and most important one is that Flyway Command-line <strong><a href="/documentation/commandline/">now
        ships with a JRE</a></strong></p>

    <img src="/assets/posts/flyway-3.2/commandline.png" alt="Flyway Command-line">

    <p><br>Why is this important? With the bundled JDBC drivers added in <a href="/blog/flyway-3.1.html">Flyway 3.1</a>
        and now the Java Runtime Environment,
        <strong>Flyway Command-line now has zero required external dependencies</strong>. All you need to do to get
        started
        is unpack the distribution, configure your database connection, add your first SQL migration files and off you
        go.
        <a href="/getstarted/firststeps/commandline.html">Getting started</a> has never been easier!
    </p>

    <p>The other improvement we made is the ability to <strong>easily share an installation</strong>. Flyway will now by
        default also look for a <code>flyway.conf</code> file in the current directory. And all relative paths are now
        relative
        to the current directory as well. This is great for server environments, where one read-only installation of the
        Flyway Command-line
        distribution can then be shared by many projects.</p>

    <p>Last but not least, we also added a <code>-q</code> switch to <strong>only output errors and warnings</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>solidDB support</h2>

    <p>Building upon the <a href="/#databases">ever growing list</a> of supported databases, this release adds official
        support for <a href="http://unicomsi.com/products/soliddb/">solidDB</a>:</p>

    <h2>Improved JavaBean-style configuration</h2>

    <p>On projects working with Spring's XML configuration, JavaBean-style property access is the way to go. In the
        past,
        Flyway has overloaded a number of accessors, making this harder than it should have been. This has now been
        fixed.
        As of Flyway 3.2, <strong>all properties are configurable using JavaBean-style accessors</strong> as used by
        Spring XML. As usual,
        Flyway makes things easy and the old
        methods have first been deprecated to ensure a smooth migration path. They will only be removed in 4.0
    </p>
