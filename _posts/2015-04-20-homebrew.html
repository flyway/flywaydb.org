    <p>Last month the <a href="/blog/flyway-3.2">Flyway 3.2</a> and 3.2.1 releases came with a number of improvements to the command-line tool.</p>

    <p>In fact the <a href="/documentation/commandline">command-line tool</a> has seen tremendous growth and is now by far the most popular way to use Flyway.
    And it turns out (surprise surprise) a large number of you are using Mac OSX.</p>

    <p>The 3.2 release made it easier to run Flyway on your Mac, by bundling a private JRE, removing the need to install Java separately and ensuring the bundled version always works perfectly with Flyway.</p>

    <p>However, many Mac users these days prefer to install their software another way...</p>
