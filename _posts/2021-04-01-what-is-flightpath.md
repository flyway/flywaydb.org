Back in August 2020 we introduced Flightpath as an idea in its infancy. You can read the original blog post [here]().

Since then, we have been working to make Flightpath a reality for each and every one of you.

Check out this quick video introduction of Flightpath:

## What does Flightpath offer me?

Metadata about your Flyway deployments naturally accrues over time, and Flightpath will be the looking glass through which you will be able to visualize it all.

Understanding the metrics gathered from this metadata will help you understand and improve your experience with Flyway.

All of this will be available to you at no cost!

## How can I get involved?

We are interested in your views and opinions about what Flightpath should be as it will be a tool for you, to help you.
