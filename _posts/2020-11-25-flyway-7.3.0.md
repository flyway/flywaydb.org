**Flyway 7.3.0** is out! This release contains new features and improvements over Flyway 7.2.0.

## Highlights
- A placeholder for the full path of a migration file
- Retrying connections back off exponentially
- Dry Run output can be directed to AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage

You can find a detailed list of the changes in the [release notes](/documentation/learnmore/releaseNotes#7.3.0).

### Migration filename placeholder

It can be useful to know the full path of a migration file at the time it's executed, for auditing purposes. The 
migration description is of course preserved in Flyway's history, but this wasn't available to the migration
itself. You can now use the placeholder `${flyway.filename}` and the migration's full path will be substituted.

See [the documentation](/documentation/configuration/placeholder) for more details. 

### Retrying connections

When Flyway is not able to make a database connection, it will try again. However, retrying at 1
second intervals will cause a significant number of errors if the database is busy or unavailable for some
time, and that may be unwelcome if, for example, each one results in an alert in a monitoring system. So,
Flyway now increases the interval between retries exponentially as the number of failures increases. The
more failures Flyway encounters, the more likely it is that the database will not be available any time soon
and that more attempts will just add noise into the situation.

### Dry Run output to cloud storage

Migrations can already be stored in, and read from, AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage. You can now send Dry Run
output to a bucket in either platform in exactly the same way - just specify `s3:<bucket>/<filename>` or
`gcs:<bucket>/<filename>` in the `flyway.dryRunOutput` parameter similarly to the way you would for 
`flyway.locations`. 

See [the documentation](/documentation/configuration/dryRunOutput/) for more details, including necessary libraries
and authentication options.
