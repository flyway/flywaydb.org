subtitle: Handling multiple schemas in the same database with Flyway

Flyway offers a range of options for handling multiple schemas in the same database. Let's take a look at some of them.

## Configuration

There are two main configuration parameters; `flyway.schemas` and `flyway.defaultSchema`. In this post we'll talk
about them as being in `flyway.conf`, but of course the same will apply whether you choose to use them in configuration
files, environment variables, the Java API or command line parameters.

### flyway.defaultSchema

This parameter sets the default schema for the connection. That is, if we put an unqualified object name in our 
migration, it will be assumed to be in the default schema. So a migration:

```
CREATE TABLE MyTable (id INT);
```

run with `flyway.defaultSchema=julia` is equivalent to `CREATE TABLE julia.MyTable (...)`. If we want to interact
with other schemas, we need to use fully-qualified object names. This schema is also where we will put our 
schema history table.

Not all databases have a concept of a default schema, and perhaps more awkwardly, some have gotchas - SQL Server,
for example, has a concept of a default schema but it's quietly ignored if you are a member of the sysadmin server role
such as `sa`. However, this parameter is still useful, as it is used to populate the corresponding placeholder.
So, the following migration would still create our table in the relevant schema:

```
CREATE TABLE ${flyway:defaultSchema}.MyTable (id INT);
```

### flyway.schemas

This parameter doesn't affect migrations, unless you've chosen not to specify `defaultSchema` (in which case the first 
schema in this list is treated as the default). It is useful mostly in a development scenario; when you first `migrate`,
all these schemas will be created if they didn't already exist, and when you `clean` Flyway will empty them again.

## Many different schemas, many histories

This is the simplest scenario, as all our schemas are effectively separate entities and can happily co-exist in different
states. Each schema will be built up from a different set of scripts, which is probably best served by building up
separate configuration files for each schema:

```
flyway.defaultSchema=foo
flyway.locations=c:\src\migrations\foo\
```

and then migrating each one in turn:

```
# Powershell
$schemas = @('foo', 'bar')
foreach ($schema in $schemas) { flyway migrate -configfFiles="c:\src\config\$schema.conf" }
```

```
#!/bin/bash
schemas=(foo bar)
for schema in "${schemas[@]}"
do
    flyway migrate -configFiles="/src/config/$schema.conf" 
done
```

## One desired schema structure, many histories

Now suppose we have a multi-tenant database where we want all schemas to have an identical structure. Now, we no longer
need separate sets of scripts - and moreover, we no longer want separate sets of scripts, as having a single set will
enforce that uniformity for us. Instead of iterating over configurations, we can iterate instead over the schemas,
using the `${flyway:defaultSchema}` placeholder in any script that needs a fully qualified name:

```
# Powershell
$schemas = @('foo', 'bar')
foreach ($schema in $schemas) { flyway migrate -configfFiles="c:\src\config\flyway.conf" -defaultSchema="$schema" }
```

Having a separate history table in each schema appears redundant in that the same sequence of migrations will be
recorded in each table, and calling `migrate` repeatedly like this will migrate each schema up to the same state
(assuming no new migrations are created while Flyway is busy!). However, it does mean that when we need a new
schema with the same structure, we can simply add it
to the list, and Flyway will create it automatically and migrate it forwards through the same sequence as all the
others until it has reached the latest structure.

This method is also failure-resistant - if Flyway fails on one schema, the history tables contain enough information
that once the failure is cleared, Flyway will do the right thing on future runs.  

It is possible to do similar iterations with Maven and Gradle; in addition in Maven there is the 
[`iterator-maven-plugin`](https://github.com/khmarbaise/iterator-maven-plugin) which makes iterating over a collection of 

## One desired schema structure, one history

This is the most tricky scenario, as it requires each migration to handle the iteration across schemas - which makes
the migrations more complex as they will need to use dynamic SQL. Adding a new schema is also much more complex;
suppose we've run three migrations on schemas `foo` and `bar`, and now we want to add schema `baz`. The history table
tells us we've run three migrations, but not which schemas were involved. So to get `baz` up to the correct state
we need another migration, #4 - and that migration now needs to check each schema in turn, and if they are not at the
right state, re-run migrations #1, #2 and #3 somehow. 

The prospect of errors during the catch-up process complicates things further. What happens if something fails
while schema `baz` is being brought up to the current state? We have no way of reflecting that in the history table as 
it stands, and so we would need more SQL to figure out what state it was in. 

So, we can't recommend this approach.

## But that's not the end of the story...

We recognise that databases with large numbers of identical schemas are an increasingly common situation. We'd like
to hear from you if you have such a database! Do the above iterative methods work for you? If not, how could we
best support you? There's a discussion Issue open at [Github Issues](https://github.com/flyway/flyway/issues/2995)
where we would really value your feedback as we figure out what would be the best way to implement support for you.
