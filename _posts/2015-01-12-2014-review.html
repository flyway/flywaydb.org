    <p>It's been quite a year for Flyway! Let's look back at some of the highlights:</p>

    <h2>Releases</h2>

    <p>2014 saw the releases of <strong><a href="/blog/flyway-3.0-android">Flyway 3.0</a></strong> and
        <strong><a href="/blog/flyway-3.1">Flyway 3.1</a></strong>, which both brought along some solid
        enhancements:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Android support</li>
        <li>SQLite, MariaDB, Redshift, Vertica and DB2 z/OS support</li>
        <li>SQL- &amp; Java-based callbacks</li>
        <li>Custom MigrationResolvers &amp; Executors</li>
        <li>JDBC drivers shipping with the command-line tool</li>
        <li>And many more bug fixes and improvements across the board</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Adoption</h2>

    <p>This past year Flyway started seeing very widespread adoption. It enjoyed a wide number of user groups,
        tech talks and conference appearances. Or as this particular JavaOne attendee would say:</p>

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Is there a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaOne?src=hash">#JavaOne</a> conspiracy to favor <a href="https://twitter.com/FlywayDb">@FlywayDb</a> (because <a href="https://twitter.com/axelfontaine">@axelfontaine</a> is speaker?) over other db migration tools? 3+ talks advocated it.</p>&mdash; Alexander Müller (@visusnet) <a href="https://twitter.com/visusnet/status/517790841096511489">October 2, 2014</a></blockquote>

    <p>Thanks to our many great users and vocal supporters, this is the type of conspiracy we love indeed!</p>

    <h2>ThoughtWorks Technology Radar</h2>

    <p>ThoughtWorks first picked up Flyway in their
        <a href="/blog/thoughtworks-technology-radar">July 2014 Technology Radar</a>, only to double down on
    it in their <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/flyway">January 2015 edition</a>, by giving Flyway their highest distinction:</p>

    </div>

    <p>This is what they had to say in the January 2015 edition:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <strong>Flyway</strong><br/><br/>
        With techniques such as continuous delivery becoming more mainstream, automated database migrations are a baseline capability for many software teams. While there are many tools in this space, we continue to recommend <strong>Flyway</strong> for its low-friction approach. Flyway has a vibrant open-source community behind it, and support for both traditional and cloud-based databases such as Amazon Redshift and Google Cloud SQL.
    </blockquote>

    <p>This is what the <strong>Adopt</strong> recommendation means:</p>

    <blockquote>The <strong>Adopt</strong> Ring represents blips that we think you should be using now. We don't say that you should use these for every project, any tool should only be used in an appropriate context. However we do think that a blip in the adopt ring represents something where there is no doubt that it's proven and mature for use.</blockquote>

    <p>In other words:</p>

    <blockquote>For the Adopt Ring we make use of Mason's Razor (since Mike Mason came up with it). Things only go in the Adopt Ring if we would laugh at you in the pub for not using them on an appropriate project.</blockquote>

    <p>Thank you ThoughtWorks for the <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/flyway">strong vote of confidence</a>!</p>

    <h2>Stats</h2>

    <p>Last, but not least, the download stats. And they have been phenomenal. We now passed <strong>250,000 downloads in 2014</strong> alone!</p>

    <p>Here is the monthly breakdown:</p>

    <p>This has been the evolution over the past 4 years:</p>
