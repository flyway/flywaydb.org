Flyway comes out of the box with integrations for [Maven](/documentation/usage/maven), [Gradle](/documentation/usage/gradle)
and [Docker](/documentation/usage/commandline).

The broader Flyway community however maintains a much larger collection of integrations and plugins. This tools and
platforms being integrated with include application frameworks, CI servers, deployment automation platforms, build tools
and much more.

To make it easier for you to find these we have now created a [brand new curated page](/documentation/plugins) where we
have listed them for you:

<a href="/documentations/plugins"><img class="screenshot" title="Community Plugins page" src="/assets/posts/community-plugins/plugins.png"></a>

Enjoy and don't hesitate to [let us know](https://github.com/flyway/flywaydb.org) if we missed yours!
