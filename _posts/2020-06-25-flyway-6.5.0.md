### Toggle schema creation

By default, Flyway will attempt to create the schemas provided by the `schemas` and `defaultSchema` configuration options. This behavior can be toggled with the `createSchemas` configuration option.

This might be useful when you want complete control over how schemas are created.

See [the documentation](../documentation/migrations/#toggle-schema-creation) for more details.

### Script encoding
Script config files have been extended to allow for specifying the encoding of the script they are linked to.

```properties
# Encoding of this SQL migration. Caution: changing the encoding after this migration has been run
# will invalidate the calculated checksum and require a `flyway repair`.
encoding=ISO_8859_1
```

See [the documentation](../documentation/scriptconfigfiles) for more details.
