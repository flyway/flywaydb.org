## Highlights

We are pleased to announce that Flyway 6.2.4 has been released.

- Add Oracle SQL*Plus `SPOOL` command support
- Avoid prompting for unnecessary credentials when using integrated authentication for SQL Server and Snowflake key-based auth
- Some bugs around **MySQL** and **MariaDB** have been fixed

You can find a detailed list of issues fixed in the [release notes](/documentation/learnmore/releaseNotes#6.2.4).

You may have noticed that we've upped the frequency of patch releases recently. For the foreseeable future we hope 
to release weekly, provided that there is something to release in that week, so that we get issues resolved more quickly.
These posts should give you an indication of who will benefit from each version as it goes live - we don't expect
anyone to need to upgrade every week! 

## Download it now and enjoy!
