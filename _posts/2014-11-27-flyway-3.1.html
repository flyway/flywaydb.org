    <p>Well it looks like this year, Christmas came early! Here is our next version: <strong>Flyway 3.1</strong>.</p>

    <p>The <strong>hightlights</strong> of this release are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Redshift, Vertica and DB2 z/OS support</li>
        <li>SQL-based callbacks</li>
        <li>JDBC drivers shipping with the command-line tool</li>
        <li>Renamed init into baseline</li>
        <li>Feature / bug fix sponsoring</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Redshift, Vertica and DB2 z/OS support</h2>

    <div class="blog-post-image">

    </div>

    <p>While <a href="/blog/flyway-3.0-android">Flyway 3.0</a> focused on the small with
        <a href="/documentation/database/sqlite">SQLite</a> and <a href="/documentation/usage/api/">Android</a> support,
        this releases focuses on the big. We are expanding the large list of supported databases to three new ones in
        the
        big data and the big iron space:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Amazon Redshift</li>
        <li>HP Vertica</li>
        <li>DB2 z/OS</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Special thanks to Nathan Vick and Christine Teig for contributing these integrations.</p>

    <h2>SQL-based callbacks</h2>

    <p>Building upon the <a href="/documentation/concepts/callbacks">Lifecycle Callback</a> foundation we laid in Flyway
        3.0, we now made Callbacks even more accessible to a wider audience.</p>

    <p>You now have the option to simply drop a SQL file with the name of the callback in one of the configured
        locations and it will be executed at the appropriate point in the lifecycle.</p>

    <h3>Example</h3>

    <p>Suppose you are using Oracle and you regularly write migrations that perform DDL operations that invalidate
        objects
        in the MYSCHEMA schema.</p>

    <p>
        With Flyway's default command-line client settings, all you need to automatically trigger a recompile of all
        objects after a migration run,
        is add a file called <code>afterMigrate.sql</code> to the <code>/sql</code> directory of your installation:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">BEGIN
   DBMS_UTILITY.COMPILE_SCHEMA(SCHEMA => 'MYSCHEMA');
END;</pre>

    <p>And voila! It will automatically run every time after migrate completes.</p>

    <h2>JDBC drivers shipping with the command-line tool</h2>

    <p>Flyway Command-line client download numbers have been growing very rapidly (chart from Maven Central):</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image">
        <img src="/assets/posts/flyway-3.1/commandline-downloads.png" alt="Flyway Command-line Downloads">
    </div>

    <p>In fact, the command-line client has now even surpassed the Java API by number of downloads as the most popular
        way to use Flyway. This is primarily due to many non-JVM users, looking for a simple, polished and powerful
        solution to their database migration challenges.</p>

    <p>And so we decided to take a hard look at the adoption barriers. Not surprisingly having to hunt for JDBC drivers
        and figuring out JDBC URL syntax turned out to be the two biggest hurdles. So we decided to tackle them.</p>

    <p>Effective as of Flyway 3.1, the Flyway Command-line distribution now ships out of the box with JDBC drivers
        for the following databases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MySQL</li>
        <li>MariaDB</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL</li>
        <li>Redshift</li>
        <li>H2</li>
        <li>Hsql</li>
        <li>Derby</li>
        <li>SQLite</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Additionally the config file now also contains <strong>examples for JDBC URLs</strong> for all supported
        databases.</p>

    <p>No more hunting and no more guessing. Non-JVM users, welcome to Flyway.</p>

    <h2>Renamed init into baseline</h2>

    <p>We like to pride ourselves with having created the easiest and most intuitive tool to work with databases
        migrations.
        Yet sometimes, when users make the same mistakes over and over again, maybe RTFM is not the answer. And this is
        exactly what happened with our support for <a href="/documentation/existing">baselining existing databases</a>: init.
    </p>

    <p>Even though the docs clearly described the intended use, the name was simply poorly chosen. Users would
        intuitively run init against new databases, only to subsequently wonder why the migrations up to the init version would be
        ignored.</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image">
        <img src="/assets/posts/flyway-3.1/init.png" alt="init to baseline">
    </div>


    <p>To eliminate this confusion once and for all, we decided to admit we made a poor choice and bite the bullet.
        <code>init</code> has now be renamed to <code>baseline</code>. We believe this is a more accurate and less
        misleading name.
    </p>

    <p>To make the transition as smooth as possible, init and all associated properties have been deprecated for the
        remainder of the 3.x timeframe to give you sufficient time to adjust. They will then be removed as part of the next
        major release.</p>

    <h2>Feature / bug fix sponsoring</h2>

    <p>We strive to make Flyway as rock solid as possible and gradually evolve the feature set in a direction that
        makes the most sense for the project. But sometimes our schedule doesn't match yours.</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image">
        <img src="/assets/posts/flyway-3.1/sponsor.png" alt="Sponsor">
    </div>

    <p>To give you the opportunity to get the bug fix or feature you require when you need it, we now offer you the
        possibility to
        <a href="/support/#sponsor">sponsor its development</a>. Besides avoiding the costs and hassles of doing
        it yourself, these are the benefits you get:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Fast turnaround</li>
        <li>Immediate access to pre-release binaries upon completion</li>
        <li>Formal invoice</li>
        <li>Competitive price based on scope</li>
        <li>No digging in the framework internals</li>
        <li>No setting up the complex dev environment</li>
        <li>No implementation and debug effort</li>
        <li>No wait/risk of rejection for a merge into the main distribution</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Features sponsored in this release</h3>

    <p>For Flyway 3.1, we would like to extend special thanks to <a href="https://www.dg-i.net/">Dembach Goo Informatik</a>
     who sponsored the development of the PostgreSQL COPY ... FROM STDIN support. This is a great addition, allowing for
    high performance bulk data imports and increased compatibility with dumps generated by pg_dump.</p>

    <p>Thank you for contributing to making Flyway even better!</p>
