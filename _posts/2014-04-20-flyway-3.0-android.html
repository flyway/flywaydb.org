<div>
    <p>Today is birthday time! This blog turns one and Flyway turns 4! And to celebrate we are releasing our next major
        version: <strong>Flyway 3.0</strong>.</p>

    <p>The <strong>hightlights</strong> of this major release are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Breaking changes</li>
        <li>Android and SQLite support</li>
        <li>MariaDB support</li>
        <li>Opening up for extension</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Breaking changes</h2>

    <p>Flyway tries very hard to stay compatible between versions. But as all major versions go, this one marks a
        transition.
        We are leaving old things behind for a brighter future ahead.</p>

    <h3>flywaydb.org transition complete</h3>

    </div>

    <p>The transition from Google Code to flywaydb.org and Github is now complete.
        Say goodbye to the old groupId and package name <strong>
            <del>com.googlecode.flyway</del>
        </strong>, and welcome <strong>org.flywaydb</strong>!
    </p>

    <p>Simply update these and you should be good to go!</p>

    <h3>Dropped features</h3>

    <p>It's spring time and we have a major release, so it's time to prune some old cruft. In this release we
        removed:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Java 5 support:</strong> The baseline is now Java 6. Java 5 users must upgrade the JRE or stay with
            Flyway 2.3.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Deprecated API:</strong> All deprecated properties and actions have been removed. The Javadoc in
            Flyway 2.X documents how to move to modern equivalents.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Flyway 1.X metadata table format:</strong> Users upgrading from 1.X must upgrade to 2.3 first, then
            to 3.0.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Android and SQLite support</h2>

    <div class="blog-post-image">
        <img src="/assets/posts/flyway-3.0-android/android-sqlite.png" alt="Android and SQLite">
    </div>

    <p>Flyway 3.0 brings solid database migrations to the Android platform. And it does so in a comprehensive way.</p>

    <p>We started with SQLite support. Flyway now works with SQLite 3.7.2 and newer both on Android (4.0 and up) with
        the <a href="https://github.com/SQLDroid/SQLDroid">SQLDroid Jdbc driver</a> and all the other platforms with the
        <a href="https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc">Xerial Jdbc driver</a>.</p>

    <p>We then integrated the Android logging system and made sure the classpath scanning works flawlessly too.</p>

    <h3>Making it work</h3>

    <p>Start by adding the <a href="https://github.com/SQLDroid/SQLDroid">SQLDroid</a> driver jar to the
        <code>libs</code> directory</p>

    <p>Then inside your main activity add this:</p>
                <pre class="prettyprint">import org.flywaydb.core.Flyway;
import org.flywaydb.core.api.android.ContextHolder;
import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase;

SQLiteDatabase db = SQLiteDatabase.openOrCreateDatabase("...", 0, null);
ContextHolder.setContext(this);
Flyway flyway = new Flyway();
flyway.setDataSource("jdbc:sqlite:" + db.getPath(), "", "");
flyway.migrate();</pre>
    <p>Now add your migrations to the <code>assests/db/migration</code> directory and you're done!</p>

    <p>P.S.: And yes, we support Java-based migrations too!</p>

    <h2>MariaDB Support</h2>

    <div class="blog-post-image">
        <img src="/assets/posts/flyway-3.0-android/mariadb.png" alt="MariaDB">
    </div>

    <p>Flyway has had MySQL support since 2010. We now built onto that foundation and added MariaDB support,
        including full support for the MariaDB Jdbc driver.</p>

    <h2>Opening up for extension</h2>

    <p>Users have been asking to be able to integrate more deeply with Flyway for a long time. We finally believe
        the core is now stable enough to open it up for extension in a way we can support for the future.</p>

    <h3>Lifecycle Callbacks</h3>

    <p>The first part we are opening up is lifecycle callbacks. You are now able to hook into all aspects of the
        Flyway lifecycle. This allows to perform whatever action you what when you want. This could be granting rights
        to all tables after all migrations complete, recompiling procedures, or whatever you need. You now get handed
        a connection within a transaction and you can use it to your liking. All you have to do is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement the new <a href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/callback/FlywayCallback.html">FlywayCallback</a>
            interface
        </li>
        <li>Register it with <code>Flyway.setCallbacks(...)</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Custom Migration Resolvers</h3>

    <p>The second part we are opening up is migration resolvers. This is for people who need more than the standard
        SQL and Java migrations. It allows you to resolve and execute migrations in any way you want. This could be
        reading test data from csv files, integrating with version control for stored procedures, or simply having
        the possibility to execute some statement outside of a transaction (very useful when you need it).
    </p>

    <p>To get started with this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement the new <a
                href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/resolver/MigrationResolver.html">MigrationResolver</a>
            interface
        </li>
        <li>Add a corresponding <a
                href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/resolver/MigrationExecutor.html">MigrationExecutor</a>
            implementation
        </li>
        <li>Register the resolver with <code>Flyway.setResolvers(...)</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>And voil√†!</p>

    <h3>The road ahead</h3>

    <p>These two extension points represent the beginning. We are extremely curious as to what extensions the community
        will come up with. We will keep a close eye on them and integrate some of the best ones in future releases.</p>

    <p>You can also expect stronger build tool integration for these extensions in the future, so that you won't have to
        write Java code anymore to enjoy them.</p>

    <h2>Grab it!</h2>

    <p>Stability and reliability are always our top priority and this release is no exception. It packs a ton of fixes
        and small improvements across the board. You can find all the details are in the <a
                href="/documentation/releaseNotes.html">release notes</a>.</p>

    <p>Thank you to everyone who reported issues and sent in pull requests. Special thanks to Dan Bunker for the
        lifecycle callbacks.</p>

    <p>Enjoy the release and <a href="/getstarted/download.html">get it while it's hot!</a></p>

    <p><strong>All users are encouraged to upgrade.</strong></p>
