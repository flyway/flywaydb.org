    <p>After exactly 4 months, I am proud to announce the release of Flyway 2.2!</p>

    <p>The highlights of this release are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gradle Support</li>
        <li>SQL Azure Support</li>
        <li>Commercial Support Plans</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gradle Support</h2>

    <p>
        This was the most requested feature by far. And here it is! Flyway now officially ships with a Gradle
        plugin!<br/>

    <p>
        &nbsp;<br/>
        We've gone to great lengths to ensure the plugin is very intuitive and very well integrated in the Gradle way
        of doing things. This is all you need in your <code>build.gradle</code> to get started:
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.googlecode.flyway:flyway-gradle-plugin:2.2"
    }
}

apply plugin: 'flyway'
apply plugin: 'java'

flyway {
    url = 'jdbc:...'
    user = '...'
}
</pre>
    <p>Make sure to check out the brand new <a href="/getstarted/firststeps/gradle.html">first steps tutorial</a>. It'll
        take 5 minutes to get started. It's that easy!</p>

    <h2>SQL Azure Support</h2>

    <p>Flyway added supported App Engine and Google Cloud SQL all the way back in version 1.6. As more and more users
        move turn the cloud, it is important for Flyway to properly support these platforms. Starting today with 2.2
        Flyway
        now fully supports SQL Azure on the Windows Azure cloud!</p>

    <h2>Commercial Support Plans</h2>

    <p>Flyway is growing fast. In fact we have already passed the 35,000 download mark for this year alone! And there is
        no stopping in sight!</p>

    <p>This means that Flyway is now deployed at an increasingly large number of companies. Lately more and more of
        these
        companies have been asking for professional support, to make sure someone is there when there is a problem.</p>

    <p>To address this, we are launching a <a href="/support">commercial support offering</a> today:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;<br/>This is purely optional and on top of the existing Stack Overflow and GitHub forums.</p>

    <h2>Get it while it's hot!</h2>

    <p>On top of the features above, this release packs a ton of bug fixes and documentation improvements. All the
        details are in the <a href="/documentation/releaseNotes.html">release notes</a>.</p>

    <p>It wouldn't have been possible without the awesome work of the many contributors. I would like extend special
        thanks to two people in particular:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Ben Manes for his great work on the Gradle Plugin</li>
        <li>David Harrigan for <a href="/support/sponsor.html">sponsoring a fix</a></li>
    </ul>
