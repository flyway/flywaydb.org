2017 is behind us, and what a year it was!
 
First a few updates on Flyway itself. 

Last year saw 3 significant Flyway releases.
We first released [Flyway 4.1.0](/blog/flyway-4.1.0), 
followed by [Flyway 4.2.0](/blog/flyway-4.2.0) in April and then finally [Flyway 5.0.0](/blog/flyway-5.0.0) 
in December. Flyway 5.0 brought a lot new things to the table, including new [Pro and Enterprise Editions](/download)
for advanced Flyway users needing features that go beyond what is included in the community edition.

It was also yet again another year of incredible growth for Flyway which grew over 268% from
1.6M downloads in 2016 to 4.3M in 2017. See for yourself:

## New tutorials

Since the release of [Flyway 5.0.0](/blog/flyway-5.0.0) we have continued pushing forward. We released 5 bug fix
releases, the latest being Flyway 5.0.5, 
and we published 5 brand new tutorials. These tutorials are aimed at users that have already completed their first steps
using Flyway and are ready to start exploring more advanced topics. Each tutorial is highly focused and takes
about 5 minutes to complete.

So without further ado, here they are:
- [Java migrations](/documentation/getstarted/java)
- [Repeatable migrations](/documentation/getstarted/repeatable)
- [Undo migrations](/documentation/getstarted/undo)
- [Callbacks](/documentation/getstarted/callbacks)
- [Error Handlers](/documentation/getstarted/errorhandlers)

If you aren't familiar with these topics, do take a few minutes to explore them. They are very useful features that can
be lifesavers when you need them.

Enjoy and have a great 2018! We have many things in store for you. This is just the beginning!
