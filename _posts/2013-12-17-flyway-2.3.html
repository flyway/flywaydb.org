    <p>As 2013 comes to a close, so does the Flyway 2.x series. But not without some fireworks!</p>

    <p>Flyway 2.3 is out and these are the highlights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SBT plugin</strong></li>
        <li>Cygwin support</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>SBT plugin</h2>

    <p>
        SBT, a.k.a. the Build Tool with No Logo, support has now rolled out, fresh of the presses.
        This should be a great addition for all the Scala and Play! projects out there. Grab it while it's hot!<br/>

    <p>
        &nbsp;<br/>
        We've once again gone to great lengths to ensure the plugin is very intuitive and very well integrated in the
        SBT way
        of doing things. This is all you need in your <code>project/plugins.sbt</code> and <code>build.sbt</code> to get
        started:
    </p>

    <code>project/plugins.sbt</code>
    <pre class="prettyprint">addSbtPlugin("com.googlecode.flyway" % "flyway-sbt" % "{{ site.flywayVersion }}")

resolvers += "Flyway" at "https://flywaydb.org/repo"</pre>

    <code>build.sbt</code>
    <pre class="prettyprint">seq(flywaySettings: _*)

flywayUrl := "jdbc:..."

flywayUser := "..."</pre>

    <p>We created a brand new <a href="/documentation/getstarted/firststeps/sbt">first steps tutorial</a> to make sure you can be
        up and running in less than 5 minutes. Check it out!</p>

    <h2>Cygwin Support</h2>

    <p>And for those working on Windows who miss the power of the Unix shell, Flyway now comes with official Cygwin
        support! The Command-line tool has been adjusted and this now works seamlessly.</p>

    <h2>Download</h2>

    <p>As always, Flyway strives to be as solid as possible. Bug fixes are prioritized over features. And this release
        is no exception, with improvements for Oracle, MySQL, DB2, Ant and Maven support.</p>

    <p>You can find all the details are in the <a href="/documentation/learnmore/releaseNotes">release notes</a>.</p>

    <p>This wouldn't have been possible without the many contributors who reported issues and sent in pull requests. I
        would like extend special thanks Christian Dedi√© for all the work on getting the SBT plugin out the door.</p>

    <p>Enjoy the release and <a href="/download">get it while it's hot!</a></p>

    <p>All users are encouraged to upgrade.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>P.S.: This should be the last non-bugfix release of Flyway 2.x. Onward and upward towards Flyway
        3.0 with Android and SQLite support!</p>
