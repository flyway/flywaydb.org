    <p>Every six months or so ThoughtWorks publish their thoughts on the software industry and where it is heading.
        They call it the <strong><a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/">ThoughtWorks Technology Radar</a></strong>.</p>

    <p>The Radar is divided in four broad categories (Techniques, Tools, Platforms and Languages and Frameworks)
        and serves as their general recommendation of what to adopt, try, assess or hold out to.</p>

    <p>Here is what <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/#/tools/flyway">ThoughtWorks say about Flyway</a>:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <strong>Flyway</strong><br/><br/>
        Automated database migrations are common on agile projects, and we are happy to see advances in the tools for this space. Flyway makes it as painless as possible to automate changes to databases. While not as feature-rich as some competing tools, we have used it on multiple projects and appreciate its low friction.
