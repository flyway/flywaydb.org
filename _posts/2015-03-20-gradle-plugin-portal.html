    <p>Hot on the heels of our <strong><a href="/blog/flyway-3.2">Flyway 3.2</a></strong> release, it is time to start leveraging
        some of the improvements that happened under the hood.

    <h2>Gradle Plugin Portal</h2>

    <p>Lately the Gradle team has been making it easier and easier to both find and use plugins. To find plugins, they now have
    their own <a href="https://plugins.gradle.org/">dedicated searchable portal</a>.</p>

    <p>We are happy to announce that starting with Flyway 3.2 the <a href="/documentation/gradle">Flyway Gradle Plugin</a>
        is now available there too:
    </p>

    <div class="blog-post-image">
        <img src="/assets/posts/gradle-plugin-portal/portal.png" alt="Gradle Plugin Portal">
    </div>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>And that's is just the beginning. If you are using Gradle 2.1 or newer and you've already switched to our new plugin id
        <strong>org.flywaydb.flyway</strong> you can now start using the new and improved plugin syntax too:
    </p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">plugins {
    id "org.flywaydb.flyway" version "3.2.1"
}</pre>

    <p>Using Flyway with Gradle has never been easier!</p>

    <h2>Flyway 3.2.1 bug fix release</h2>

    <p>If you are using Oracle, we strongly encourage you to skip Flyway 3.2 and go straight for 3.2.1. The 3.2 release
        contains an unfortunate regression in the parser, which has now been fixed.

    <h2>Enjoy!</h2>

    the next few months!</p>
