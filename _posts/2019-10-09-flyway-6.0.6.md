## Highlights

We are pleased to announce that Flyway 6.0.6 has been released. This version officially supports Cockroach 19.1 in
addition to previous supported versions, and contains some bug fixes:

- Flyway fails-fast when errorOverrides are used with batch=true
- For H2 in MySQL mode, Flyway correctly handles backticks as an identifier quote, and null placeholder values
- Some SQL*Plus parser errors have been fixed

We have also taken the opportunity to update some third-party dependencies.

You can find a detailed list of issues fixed in the [release notes](/documentation/learnmore/releaseNotes#6.0.6).

_Note: Flyway 6.0.5 was skipped due to a regression in the Community edition._
