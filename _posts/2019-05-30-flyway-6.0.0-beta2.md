Work on Flyway 6.0.0 is continuing and today we are releasing a second **early-access preview** of some of the upcoming new features.

In addition to the changes in the [first beta](/blog/flyway-6.0.0-beta), **Flyway 6.0.0-beta2** comes with the following additions and changes:
- Java 12 support
- Oracle 19c support
- Flyway Command-line now ships with Java 11
- Wildcards in errorOverrides support
- Additional SQL*Plus commands support
- Many bug fixes across the board

This is a **beta** release which, although very stable, we do not recommend to deploy in production just yet.

You can find a detailed list of issues fixed in the [release notes](/documentation/learnmore/releaseNotes#6.0.0-beta2).

It is intended to give you a preview of some of the upcoming features. We'll take a deeper dive into all these features
as part of the announcement of the final release.

Until then, please give Flyway 6.0.0-beta2 a try in your dev environments and let us know if any issues come up, so that
we can fix them in time for the final release.

Enjoy!
