One full month has now passed since the [release of Flyway 5.1.0](/blog/flyway-5.1.0). Here is an update on
a number of Flyway-related events and releases that happened since!

## 1,000,000 Docker image pulls

As part of the [Flyway 5.0.0](/blog/flyway-5.0.0) we launched [official Docker images for Flyway](https://hub.docker.com/r/boxfuse/flyway/).

And the reception has been incredible! Since launching them in December they have now been **pulled over 1 million times**!

So if you use Docker, make sure to [take the Flyway images for a spin](https://hub.docker.com/r/boxfuse/flyway/) (if haven't done so already). 

## Flyway 5.1.3 release

This past month has also see a number bug fix releases for Flyway. With Flyway 5.1.3 being the latest one. As usual you
can find the list of fixes in the [release notes](https://flywaydb.org/documentation/releaseNotes#5.1.3).

As a number of important issues have been addressed, all Flyway users are encouraged to upgrade.

## The road ahead

Work on Flyway 5.2.0 is already progressing nicely. We have a number of exciting features in store for you!

We'll be back for another update next month. Until then, happy migrating!
