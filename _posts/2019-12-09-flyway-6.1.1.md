## Highlights

We are pleased to announce that Flyway 6.1.1 has been released. This version contains some bug fixes:

- A number of fixes to delimiter parsing in Oracle and MySQL/MariaDb
- In SnowflakeDb, we can now support Javascript in stored procedures
- In CockroachDb, some migrations containing both DML and DDL would fail because they would be run in a transaction by default
- A problem where output to a log file would be lost.

You can find a detailed list of issues fixed in the [release notes](/documentation/releaseNotes#6.1.1).
