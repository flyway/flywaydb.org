    <p>Hot on the heels of <a href="/blog/flyway-4.1.0">Flyway 4.1.0</a> and the two patch releases that followed it, here is <strong>Flyway 4.2.0</strong>!</p>

    <h2>Highlights</h2>

    <p>These are the highlights of this release:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pivotal Greenplum support</li>
        <li>Support for multiple migrations within a single transaction</li>
        <li>Overall polish</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Let's dive right in!</p>

    <h3>Greenplum support</h3>

    <p>With <a href="/documentation/database/greenplum"><strong>Greenplum</strong></a> Flyway has now added support for its 20th relational databases!</p>

    <h3>Support for multiple migrations within a single transaction</h3>

    <p>Flyway always cleanly wraps the execution of a migration within a transaction. This is of course most useful
    on databases supporting DDL transactions such as PostgreSQL, DB2 or SQL Server as it means and failed statement,
        whether DDL or DML, will cause the entire migration to be cleanly rolled back.</p>

    <p>This in turn means that if multiple pending migrations are migrated in a single run each migration succeeds or fails individually.
    In certain scenarios, such as new software releases shipping with multiple new database migrations that should really
        all succeed or fail as one unit, this isn't always the desirable behavior.</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image">
        <img src="/assets/balsamiq/group.png" alt="Group">
    </div>

    <p>To address this we are introducing <strong>migration groups</strong>. When the new <code>group</code> property is
    set to <code>true</code>, all pending migrations are executing together in a single database transaction. On databases
    with DDL transactions this now means that a single failed statement, will cause all of these migrations to be cleanly
    rolled back together.</p>

    <h3>Overall polish</h3>

    <p>The improvements outlined above are by far not the only ones part of this release. Here are a few more:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Much improved clean for Oracle</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY support</li>
        <li>Better support for classpath scanning with newer Tomcat versions</li>
        <li>And much more!</li>
    </ul>
