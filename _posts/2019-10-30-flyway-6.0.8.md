## Highlights

We are pleased to announce that Flyway 6.0.8 has been released. This version contains some bug fixes:

- An unexpected error when you have non-empty schemas
- Fixed regression with forward-slash as division operator within PL/SQL
- Fixed parsing `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS` and similar statements for views and sequences in HSQLDB
- Extended the list of known MS-SQL stored procedures that cannot run in transactions

You can find a detailed list of issues fixed in the [release notes](/documentation/learnmore/releaseNotes#6.0.8).

This is intended to be the last bug fix release in the 6.0 series and, unless any serious regressions appear,
future bug fixes will be rolled up into v6.1 along with new features.
