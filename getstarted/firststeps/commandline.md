# First Steps: Command-line

This brief tutorial will teach **how to get up and running with the Flyway Command-line tool**. It will take you through the
steps on how to configure it and how to write and execute your first few database migrations.

This tutorial should take you about **5 minutes** to complete.

## Downloading and extracting Flyway

Start by <a href="/download">downloading the Flyway Command-line Tool</a> for your platform and extract it.

Let's jump into our new directory:

<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> cd flyway-{{ site.flywayVersion }}</pre>

## Configuring Flyway

Once that is done, configure Flyway by editing `/conf/flyway.conf` like this:

```properties
flyway.url=jdbc:h2:file:./foobardb
flyway.user=SA
flyway.password=
flyway.locations=filesystem:./sql
```

## Creating the first migration

Now create a first migration in the `/sql` directory called `V1__Create_person_table.sql`:

```sql
create table PERSON (
    ID int not null,
    NAME varchar(100) not null
);
```

## Migrating the database

It's now time to execute Flyway to migrate your database:

<pre class="console"><span>flyway-{{ site.flywayVersion }}&gt;</span> flyway <strong>migrate</strong></pre>

If all went well, you should see the following output:

<pre class="console">Database: jdbc:h2:file:./foobardb (H2 1.4)
Successfully validated 1 migration (execution time 00:00.008s)
Creating Schema History table: "PUBLIC"."flyway_schema_history"
Current version of schema "PUBLIC": << Empty Schema >>
Migrating schema "PUBLIC" to version 1 - Create person table
Successfully applied 1 migration to schema "PUBLIC" (execution time 00:00.033s)</pre>

## Adding a second migration

If you now add a second migration to the <code>/sql</code> directory called <code>V2__Add_people.sql</code>:

<pre class="prettyprint">insert into PERSON (ID, NAME) values (1, 'Axel');
insert into PERSON (ID, NAME) values (2, 'Mr. Foo');
insert into PERSON (ID, NAME) values (3, 'Ms. Bar');</pre>

and execute it by issuing:

<pre class="console"><span>flyway-{{ site.flywayVersion }}&gt;</span> flyway <strong>migrate</strong></pre>

You now get:

<pre class="console">Database: jdbc:h2:file:./foobardb (H2 1.4)
Successfully validated 2 migrations (execution time 00:00.018s)
Current version of schema "PUBLIC": 1
Migrating schema "PUBLIC" to version 2 - Add people
Successfully applied 1 migration to schema "PUBLIC" (execution time 00:00.016s)</pre>

## Summary

In this brief tutorial we saw how to:
- install the Flyway Command-line tool
- configure it so it can talk to our database
- write our first couple of migrations

These migrations were then successfully found and executed.
