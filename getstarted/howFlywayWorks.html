    <h1>How Flyway Works</h1>

    <p>The easiest scenario is when you point <strong>Flyway</strong> to an <strong>empty database</strong>. </p>

    <p>

    <p align="center"><img src="/assets/balsamiq/EmptyDb.png"/></p>

    <p>It will try to
        locate it&#x27;s <strong>metadata table</strong>. As the database is empty, Flyway won&#x27;t find it and will
        <strong>create</strong> it instead.<br/> <br/> You now have a database with a single empty table called <i>SCHEMA_VERSION</i>
        by default: </p>

    <p>

    <p align="center"><img src="/assets/balsamiq/EmptySchemaVersion.png"/></p>

    <p>This
        table will be used to track the state of the database. </p>

    <p>Immediatly afterwards Flyway will begin <strong>scanning the classpath</strong> of the application for <strong>migrations</strong>.
        They can be written in either Sql or Java. </p>

    <p>The migrations are then <strong>sorted</strong> based on their <strong>version number</strong> and applied in
        order: </p>

    <p>

    <p align="center"><img src="/assets/balsamiq/Migration-1-2.png"/></p>

    <p>As each
        migration gets applied, the metadata table is updated accordingly: </p>

    <p>

    <p align="center"><img src="/assets/balsamiq/SchemaVersion-1-2.png"/></p>

    <h2>Preparing an Existing database</h2>

    <p>If you started Flyway with an empty database, no worries: you&#x27;re set. Flyway will have created the metadata
        table for you and won&#x27;t have any trouble finding it&#x27;s way around. </p>

    <p>If you have an existing database that has not been filled by Flyway this is the way to go:
    <ul>
        <li>Create an initial migration script that will recreate your current state and give it a low version number.
        </li>
        <li>Use flyway:init to create the metadata table and set this script as the current version.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Upgrading an Existing database</h2>

    <p>With the metadata and the initial state in place, we can now talk about <strong>migration newer versions</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>Flyway will once again scan the classpath of the application for migrations. The migrations are checked against
        the metadata table. If their version number is lower or equal to the one of the version marked as current, they
        are ignored.<br/> <br/> The remaining migrations are the <strong>pending migrations</strong>: available,
        but not applied. </p>

    <p>

    <p align="center"><img src="/assets/balsamiq/PendingMigration.png"/></p>

    <p>They
        are then <strong>sorted by version number</strong> and <strong>executed in order</strong>: </p>

    <p>

    <p align="center"><img src="/assets/balsamiq/Migration21.png"/></p>

    <p>The <strong>metadata
        table</strong> is <strong>updated</strong> accordingly: </p>

    <p>

    <p align="center"><img src="/assets/balsamiq/SchemaVersion21.png"/></p>

    <p><strong>And
        that&#x27;s it !</strong> Every time the need to evolve the database arises (structure (ddl) or data (dml)),
        simply
        create a new Migration with a version number higher than the current one. The next time Flyway starts, it will
        find
        it and upgrade the database accordingly. </p>
