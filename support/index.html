    <h2 id="sponsor"><i class="fa fa-bullseye"></i> Sponsor a feature or bug fix</h2>

    <p>Need a feature or a bug fix? No problem. Cast your vote in the
        <a href="https://github.com/flyway/flyway/issues/">Issue Tracker.</a></p>

    <p>If it fits the vision of the project, we'll put it on the roadmap and implement it in one of the future
        releases.</p>

    <p>Do you need it faster and want to avoid the many costs and hassles of doing it yourself? We can help you.</p>

    <p><strong>You also have the option to sponsor the bug fix or feature.</strong></p>

    <p>This has many benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fast turnaround</strong>. We know the framework best, since we wrote it.</li>
        <li>Immediate access to pre-release binaries upon completion</li>
        <li>Formal invoice</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive price</strong> based on scope</li>
        <li>No digging in the framework internals</li>
        <li>No setting up the complex <a href="/documentation/contribute/code/setup">dev environment</a></li>
        <li>No implementation and debug effort</li>
        <li>No wait/risk of rejection for a merge into the main distribution</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And yes, this always includes free maintenance for all future releases.</p>

    <p>The price will cover developer time and will depend on the scope of the feature.</p>

    <p>Interested in <strong>Flyway</strong> and how to best integrate it in a <strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> workflow?</p>

    <p>Join one of our intensive two day hands-on trainings about
        <a href="https://axelfontaine.com/training/continuousdelivery.html"><strong>Architecting for Continuous Delivery and Zero Downtime</strong></a>.</p>

    <p class="training-overview"><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> is all the hype these days. This training
        makes it
        a reality. We start with an overview of what Continuous Delivery is
        and how it can help you. We then quickly dive into the details. You
        will learn what it takes to architect a Java application so that it
        can be delivered continuously into production, with code,
        configuration and database delta, multiple times a day, with <strong>Zero Downtime</strong>.</p>

    <p>
        Buckle up! This class is <strong>intensive</strong> and <strong>hands-on</strong>. You build an entire
        Java web app to the point
        where it deploys continuously, with zero downtime. We tackle
        the hard problems with a battle-tested approach you will be able to apply immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are an architect or a developer and want to gain a solid understanding of the
        techniques you need to make Continuous Delivery and Zero Downtime a success, this training is for you.
