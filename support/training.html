    <h3>Effective database migrations with Flyway</h3>

    <p>This “in-depth” intensive course equips your development team with advanced know-how of Flyway-based database
        migration - all through small, informative hands-on modules.</p>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>One day of intensive Flyway instruction. We begin with a quick overview of what problems
        database migrations tools set out to solve. We then quickly move into thorough coverage of everything from
        Flyway basics to topics like existing project integration, API and build tool plugins. We finally cover more
        advanced topics like effective test data management, backward compatible migrations and zero-downtime migrations.</p>

    <p>Besides classical instruction, I'll live code and you'll spend around half of your time hands-on with Flyway.
        This class will take you from complete newcomer status to
        Flyway competence, or from passing familiarity to Flyway and database migrations expertise.</p>
