    <h1>Sponsor a Feature or Bug fix</h1>

    <p>If there is a feature or a fix your organisation wants that fits into the product vision,
        and it hasn't been implemented yet, you also have the option to
        <strong>pay a bounty to have it implemented sooner</strong>.</p>

    <p>This has several advantages over implementing it yourself:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No need to dig in the framework internals</li>
        <li>No need to set up the <a href="/contribute/code/setup.html">dev environment</a></li>
        <li>No need to actually implement and debug it</li>
        <li>No need to maintain your own branch (with the merge hassles for subsequent releases)</li>
        <li>No need to wait until it gets approved into the main distribution</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Instead it will be developed, integrated and documented in the next official release for you.</p>

    <p>The price will cover developer time and will depend on the scope of the feature.</p>
