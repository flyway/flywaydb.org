# Environment Variables

Flyway optionally supports loading configuration via environment variables.

## Reference

The following environment variables are supported:

            This is exclusively intended as a convenience for development. Even tough we
            strongly recommend not to change migration scripts once they have been checked into SCM and run, this
            provides a way of dealing with this case in a smooth manner. The database will be wiped clean
            automatically, ensuring that the next migration will bring you back to the state checked into
            SCM.<br/><br/><strong>Warning ! Do not enable in production !</strong>

    <tr id="FLYWAY_IGNORE_MISSING_MIGRATIONS">

        <td>Ignore missing migrations when reading the schema history table. These are migrations that were performed by an
            older deployment of the application that are no longer available in this version. For example: we have migrations
            available on the classpath with versions 1.0 and 3.0. The schema history table indicates that a migration with version 2.0
            (unknown to us) has also been applied. Instead of bombing out (fail fast) with an exception, a
            warning is logged and Flyway continues normally. This is useful for situations where one must be able to deploy
            a newer version of the application even though it doesn't contain migrations included with an older one anymore.

    <tr id="FLYWAY_IGNORE_IGNORED_MIGRATIONS">
        <td>FLYWAY_IGNORE_IGNORED_MIGRATIONS</td>
        <td>Ignore ignored migrations when reading the schema history table. These are migrations that were added in between
			already migrated migrations in this version. For example: we have migrations available on the classpath with
			versions from 1.0 to 3.0. The schema history table indicates that version 1 was finished on 1.0.15, and the next
			one was 2.0.0. But with the next release a new migration was added to version 1: 1.0.16. Such scenario is ignored
			by migrate command, but by default is rejected by validate. When ignoreIgnoredMigrations is enabled, such case
			will not be reported by validate command. This is useful for situations where one must be able to deliver
			complete set of migrations in a delivery package for multiple versions of the product, and allows for further
			development of older versions.

            newer deployment of the application that are not yet available in this version. For example: we have migrations
            available on the classpath up to version 3.0. The schema history table indicates that a migration to version 4.0
            (unknown to us) has already been applied. Instead of bombing out (fail fast) with an exception, a
            warning is logged and Flyway continues normally. This is useful for situations where one must be able to redeploy
            an older version of the application after the database has been migrated by a newer one.</td>

    <tr id="FLYWAY_CLEAN_DISABLED">

        <td>FLYWAY_BASELINE_ON_MIGRATE</td>
        <td>Whether to automatically call baseline when migrate is executed against a non-empty schema with no metadata

            This schema will then be baselined with the <code>baselineVersion</code> before executing the migrations.
            Only migrations above <code>baselineVersion</code> will then be applied.<br/>

            <p>This is useful for initial Flyway production deployments on projects with an existing DB.</p>

            <p>Be careful when enabling this as it removes the safety net that ensures Flyway does not migrate the wrong
                database in case of a configuration mistake!</p>
