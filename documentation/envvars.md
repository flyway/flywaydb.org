# Environment Variables

The Flyway [command-line tool](/documentation/commandline), [Maven plugin](/documentation/maven) and
[Gradle plugin](/documentation/gradle) support loading configuration via environment variables.
This also possible using the Flyway API by calling the `envVars()` method on the configuration.

## Reference

The following environment variables are supported:
