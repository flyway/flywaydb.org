    <h1>Code: Submit your Changes</h1>

    <p>Congratulations! You now have a fully functional dev environment for Flyway. You can start contributing!</p>

    <h2>Raise an issue</h2>

    <p>The first step is to raise an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/flyway/flyway/issues?state=open">Issue
        Tracker</a>. This issue will be the place where you will be able to communicate with Flyway&#x27;s committers
        and other users. You can use it to present your ideas and gather feedback. </p>


    <h2>Fork the repository</h2>

    <p>The next step is to fork the <a href="https://github.com/flyway/flyway">GitHub repository</a>:

    <h2>Create the test DBs</h2>

    <div class="well well-small">
        <strong>Tip:</strong>
        If your feature/bug fix doesn't impact the DB-specific code<br/> and you do not wish to set up all the databases, Flyway can be built using either:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>mvn install -P-CommercialDBTest</strong> (skip Oracle, DB2 &amp; SQL Server)</li>
            <li><strong>mvn install -P-InstallableDBTest -P-CommercialDBTest</strong> (skip all DBs, except in-memory ones)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This will disable all tests against the skipped DBs.</p>
        You can then omit installing them and continue to <a href="submit">Submit your Changes</a>.
    </div>

    <p>Execute <code>createDBs.cmd</code> to create all local test DBs. </p>

    <div class="well well-small">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> If you wish to install the DBs on
        different hosts or ports, or use different usernames and passwords, you can override the default setting
        in <strong>${user.home}/flyway-mediumtests.properties</strong>
    </div>

    <h2>Write awesome code</h2>

    <p>Now is the time to work your magic and implement stuff! Commit your changes to your fork and don't forget to pull
        and
        merge the changes from the main repo as they happen.</p>

    <p>We use IntelliJ to develop Flyway. The <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/free_java_ide.html">free
        community edition</a> fits the bill perfectly. </p>

    <p>All source code is formatted using the default IntelliJ settings. </p>

    <h2>Publish your changes</h2>

    <p>Satisfied with your work? Great! Show the world! Create a <strong>pull request</strong> and briefly describe your
        changes:</p>

    Step 1: <br/>
    <img src="/documentation/contribute/code/pull-request.png" alt="Pull Request">
    <br/><br/><br/>
    Step 2: <br/>
    <img src="/documentation/contribute/code/pull-request2.png" alt="Pull Request2">

    <p>We'll have a look at them and provide you feedback until they're
        ready to be merged. If they are approved, we'll merge them in the mainline and include them in the next
        release!</p>

    <p><br/><br/><strong>Happy coding!</strong></p>
