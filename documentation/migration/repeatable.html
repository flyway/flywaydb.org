    <h1>Repeatable migrations</h1>

    <p>Repeatable migrations do not have a version. Instead they are (re-)applied every time their checksum changes.</p>

    <p>This is very useful for managing database objects whose definition can then simply be maintained in a single file in version control.</p>

    <p>Within a single migration run, repeatable migrations are always applied last, after all pending versioned migrations have been executed. Repeatable migrations are applied in the order of their description.</p>

    <p>It is your responsibility to ensure the same repeatable migration can be applied multiple times. This usually
        involves making use of <code>CREATE OR REPLACE</code> clauses in your DDL statements.</p>

    <h2>Usages</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>(Re-)creating views/procedures/functions/packages/...</li>
        <li>Bulk reference data reinserts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example</h2>

    <p><code>R__Blue_cars.sql</code></p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW blue_cars AS SELECT id, license_plate FROM cars WHERE color='blue';</pre>
