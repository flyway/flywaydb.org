    <h1>Maven Goal: Validate</h1>

    <p>Validate applied migrations against resolved ones (on the filesystem or classpath)
    to detect accidental changes that may prevent the schema(s) from being recreated exactly.</p>
    <p>Validation fails if</p>
    <ul>
        <li>differences in migration names, types or checksums are found</li>
        <li>versions have been applied that aren't resolved locally anymore</li>
        <li>versions have been resolved that haven't been applied yet</li>
    </ul>

                automatically, ensuring that the next migration will bring you back to the state checked into
                SCM.<br/><br/><strong>Warning ! Do not enable in production !</strong>

				by migrate command, but by default is rejected by validate. When ignoreIgnoredMigrations is enabled, such case
