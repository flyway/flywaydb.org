# Baseline

Baselines an existing database, excluding all migrations up to and including baselineVersion.

![Baseline](/assets/balsamiq/command-baseline.png)

Baseline is for introducing Flyway to [existing databases](/documentation/learnmore/existing) by baselining them
at a specific version. This will cause [Migrate](/documentation/command/migrate) to ignore all migrations
up to and including the baseline version. Newer migrations will then be applied as usual.

## Resetting the baseline

When you have many migrations, it might be desirable to reset your baseline migration. This will allow you to reduce the build of old scripts.
