            by migrate command, but by default is rejected by validate. When ignoreIgnoredMigrations is enabled, such case
            will not be reported by validate command. This is useful for situations where one must be able to deliver
            complete set of migrations in a delivery package for multiple versions of the product, and allows for further
            development of older versions.
