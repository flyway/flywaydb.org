    <h1>Gradle Task: flywayValidate</h1>

    <p>Validate applied migrations against resolved ones (on the filesystem or classpath)
        to detect accidental changes that may prevent the schema(s) from being recreated exactly.</p>
    <p>Validation fails if</p>
    <ul>
        <li>differences in migration names, types or checksums are found</li>
        <li>versions have been applied that aren't resolved locally anymore</li>
        <li>versions have been resolved that haven't been applied yet</li>
    </ul>

                This is exclusively intended as a convenience for development. Even tough we
                strongly recommend not to change migration scripts once they have been checked into SCM and run, this
                provides a way of dealing with this case in a smooth manner. The database will be wiped clean
                automatically, ensuring that the next migration will bring you back to the state checked into
                SCM.<br/><br/><strong>Warning ! Do not enable in production !</strong>

				one was 2.0.0. But with the next release a new migration was added to version 1: 1.0.16. Such scenario is ignored
				by migrate command, but by default is rejected by validate. When ignoreIgnoredMigrations is enabled, such case
				will not be reported by validate command. This is useful for situations where one must be able to deliver
				complete set of migrations in a delivery package for multiple versions of the product, and allows for further
				development of older versions.
