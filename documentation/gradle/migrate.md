# Gradle Task: flywayMigrate

Migrates the schema to the latest version. Flyway will create the schema history table automatically if it doesn't
    exist.

            one was 2.0.0. But with the next release a new migration was added to version 1: 1.0.16. Such scenario is ignored
            by migrate command, but by default is rejected by validate. When ignoreIgnoredMigrations is enabled, such case
            will not be reported by validate command. This is useful for situations where one must be able to deliver

            development of older versions.
