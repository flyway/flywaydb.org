<h1>Gradle Task: flywayMigrate</h1>

<p>Migrates the schema to the latest version. Flyway will create the metadata table automatically if it doesn't
    exist.</p>

            This is exclusively intended as a convenience for development. Even tough we
            strongly recommend not to change migration scripts once they have been checked into SCM and run, this
            provides a way of dealing with this case in a smooth manner. The database will be wiped clean
            automatically, ensuring that the next migration will bring you back to the state checked into
            SCM.<br/><br/><strong>Warning ! Do not enable in production !</strong>

            This schema will then be baselined with the <code>baselineVersion</code> before executing the migrations.
            Only migrations above <code>baselineVersion</code> will then be applied.<br/>

            <p>This is useful for initial Flyway production deployments on projects with an existing DB.</p>

            <p>Be careful when enabling this as it removes the safety net that ensures Flyway does not migrate the wrong
                database in case of a configuration mistake!</p>
