# Gradle Task: flywayValidate

Validate applied migrations against resolved ones (on the filesystem or classpath)
to detect accidental changes that may prevent the schema(s) from being recreated exactly.

Validation fails if
- differences in migration names, types or checksums are found
- versions have been applied that aren't resolved locally anymore
- versions have been resolved that haven't been applied yet

            one was 2.0.0. But with the next release a new migration was added to version 1: 1.0.16. Such scenario is ignored
            by migrate command, but by default is rejected by validate. When ignoreIgnoredMigrations is enabled, such case
            will not be reported by validate command. This is useful for situations where one must be able to deliver
            complete set of migrations in a delivery package for multiple versions of the product, and allows for further
            development of older versions.
