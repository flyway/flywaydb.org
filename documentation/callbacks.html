    <h1>Callbacks</h1>

    <p>While migrations are sufficient for most needs, there are certain situations that require you to <strong>execute the same action
    over and over again</strong>. This could be recompiling procedures, updating materialized views and many other types of housekeeping.</p>

    <p>For this reason, Flyway offers you the possibility to <strong>hook into its lifecycle</strong> by using Callbacks.</p>

    <p>These are the hooks Flyway supports:</p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th><strong>Name</strong></th>
            <th><strong>Execution</strong></th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>beforeMigrate</td>
            <td>Before Migrate runs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>beforeEachMigrate</td>
            <td>Before every single migration during Migrate</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>afterEachMigrate</td>
            <td>After every single migration during Migrate</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>afterMigrate</td>
            <td>After Migrate runs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>beforeClean</td>
            <td>Before Clean runs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>afterClean</td>
            <td>After Clean runs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>beforeInfo</td>
            <td>Before Info runs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>afterInfo</td>
            <td>After Info runs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>beforeValidate</td>
            <td>Before Validate runs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>afterValidate</td>
            <td>After Validate runs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>beforeBaseline</td>
            <td>Before Baseline runs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>afterBaseline</td>
            <td>After Baseline runs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>beforeRepair</td>
            <td>Before Repair runs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>afterRepair</td>
            <td>After Repair runs</td>

        </tbody>

    <p>Callbacks can be implemented either in SQL or in Java.</p>

    <h2>SQL Callbacks</h2>

    <p>The most convenient way to hook into Flyway's lifecycle is through SQL callbacks. These are simply sql files
        in the configured locations following a certain naming convention: the callback name followed by the SQL migration suffix.</p>

    <p>Using the default settings, Flyway looks in its default locations (&lt;install_dir&gt;/sql) for the Command-line tool) for SQL files like beforeMigrate.sql, beforeEachMigrate.sql, afterEachMigrate.sql, ...</p>

    <p>Placeholder replacement works just like it does for <a href="/documentation/migration/sql">SQL migrations</a>.</p>

    <h2>Java Callbacks</h2>

    <p>If SQL Callbacks aren't flexible enough for you, you have the option to subclass the
        <strong><a href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/callback/BaseFlywayCallback">BaseFlywayCallback</a></strong>
        class yourself. You can even hook multiple Callback implementations in the lifecycle.
