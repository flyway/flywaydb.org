# Callbacks

While migrations are sufficient for most needs, there are certain situations that require you to <strong>execute the same action
over and over again</strong>. This could be recompiling procedures, updating materialized views and many other types of housekeeping.

For this reason, Flyway offers you the possibility to **hook into its lifecycle** by using Callbacks.

These are the events Flyway supports:
<table class="table table-hover">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th><strong>Name</strong></th>
        <th><strong>Execution</strong></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>beforeMigrate</td>
        <td>Before Migrate runs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>beforeRepeatables</td>
        <td>Before all repeatable migrations during Migrate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>beforeEachMigrate</td>
        <td>Before every single migration during Migrate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>beforeEachMigrateStatement {% include pro.html %}</td>
        <td>Before every single statement of a migration during Migrate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>afterEachMigrateStatement {% include pro.html %}</td>
        <td>After every single successful statement of a migration during Migrate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>afterEachMigrateStatementError {% include pro.html %}</td>
        <td>After every single failed statement of a migration during Migrate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>afterEachMigrate</td>
        <td>After every single successful migration during Migrate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>afterEachMigrateError</td>
        <td>After every single failed migration during Migrate</td>

Callbacks can be implemented either in SQL or in Java.

## SQL Callbacks

The most convenient way to hook into Flyway's lifecycle is through SQL callbacks. These are simply sql files
in the configured locations following a certain naming convention: the event name followed by the SQL migration suffix.

Using the default settings, Flyway looks in its default locations (&lt;install_dir&gt;/sql) for the Command-line tool)
for SQL files like `beforeMigrate.sql`, `beforeEachMigrate.sql`, `afterEachMigrate.sql`, ...

Placeholder replacement works just like it does for <a href="/documentation/migrations#sql-based-migrations">SQL migrations</a>.

Optionally the callback may also include a description. In that case the callback name is composed of the event name,
the separator, the description and the suffix. Example: `beforeRepair__vacuum.sql`.

**Note:** Flyway will also honor any `sqlMigrationSuffixes` you have configured, when scanning for SQL callbacks.

## Java Callbacks

If SQL Callbacks aren't flexible enough for you, you have the option to implement the
[**Callback**](/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/callback/Callback)
interface yourself. You can even hook multiple Callback implementations in the lifecycle. Java callbacks have the
additional flexibility that a single Callback implementation can handle multiple lifecycle events, and are
therefore not bound by the SQL callback naming convention.

**More info:** [Java-based Callbacks](/documentation/api/hooks#callsbacks)

## Callback ordering

When multiple callbacks for the same event are found, they are executed in the alphabetical order.
