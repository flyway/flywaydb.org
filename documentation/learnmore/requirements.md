# Requirements

## Minimal system requirements

Flyway is designed to be as lightweight as possible. We recommend that you need as an absolute minimum:

- 160MB disc space
- 256MB RAM
- 512MHz processor

Though clearly the higher specification the machine, the better your experience will be. For more details, refer to the [Oracle guidelines](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/sysreq.html) for running Java-based applications. Disc space can be saved by removing unwanted JDBC drivers, and also the embedded JRE if you have an alternative one already installed.

## Supported Java Platforms

- AdoptOpenJDK
- Oracle JDK
