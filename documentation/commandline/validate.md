# Command-line: validate

Validate applied migrations against resolved ones (on the filesystem or classpath)
to detect accidental changes that may prevent the schema(s) from being recreated exactly.

Validation fails if
- differences in migration names, types or checksums are found
- versions have been applied that aren't resolved locally anymore
- versions have been resolved that haven't been applied yet
