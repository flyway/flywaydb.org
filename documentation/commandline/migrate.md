# Command-line: migrate

Migrates the schema to the latest version. Flyway will create the schema history table automatically if it doesn't
    exist.

            one was 2.0.0. But with the next release a new migration was added to version 1: 1.0.16. Such scenario is ignored
            by migrate command, but by default is rejected by validate. When ignoreIgnoredMigrations is enabled, such case
