    <h1>Command-line: validate</h1>

    <p>Validate applied migrations against resolved ones (on the filesystem or classpath)
        to detect accidental changes that may prevent the schema(s) from being recreated exactly.</p>
    <p>Validation fails if</p>
    <ul>
        <li>differences in migration names, types or checksums are found</li>
        <li>versions have been applied that aren't resolved locally anymore</li>

                strongly recommend not to change migration scripts once they have been checked into SCM and run, this
                provides a way of dealing with this case in a smooth manner. The database will be wiped clean
                automatically, ensuring that the next migration will bring you back to the state checked into
                SCM.<br/><br/><strong>Warning ! Do not enable in production !</strong>
