    <h1>API: hooks</h1>

    <p>There are three ways you can hook into the Flyway API.</p>

    <h2>Java-based Migrations</h2>

    <p>The first one is the the most common one: <a href="/documentation/migration/java">Java-based Migrations</a>
    when you need more power than SQL can offer you. This is great to for dealing with LOBs or performing advanced
    data transformations.</p>

    <p>This can be achieved by subclassing <strong><a
            href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/migration/jdbc/BaseJdbcMigration"
            >BaseJdbcMigration</a></strong> interface.</p>

    <p>Alternatively Spring users may prefer to subclass <strong><a
            href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/migration/spring/BaseSpringJdbcMigration"
            >BaseSpringJdbcMigration</a></strong> interface to gain access to a Spring JdbcTemplate instead of a plain JDBC connection.</p>

    <p>For even more flexibility with regard to naming and checksums you can additionally implement the <strong><a
            href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/migration/MigrationInfoProvider"
            >MigrationInfoProvider</a></strong> and <strong><a
            href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/migration/MigrationChecksumProvider"
            >MigrationChecksumProvider</a></strong> interfaces.</p>

    <p>If you decide to no use the provided base implementations, you can also implement the corresponding interfaces
        directly. In that case, to access the Flyway configuration your migration can implement <strong><a
            href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/configuration/ConfigurationAware"
            >ConfigurationAware</a></strong> and Flyway will automatically inject an instance of <strong><a
            href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/configuration/FlywayConfiguration"
            >FlywayConfiguration</a></strong>. The Base* implementations already provide this configuration
    using the <strong>flywayConfiguration</strong>-field.</p>

    <h2 id="callbacks">Java-based Callbacks</h2>

    <p>Building upon that are the <a href="/documentation/callbacks">Java-based Callbacks</a>
        when you need more power or flexibility in a Callback than SQL can offer you.</p>

    <p>This can be achieved by implementing the <strong><a href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/callback/FlywayCallback">FlywayCallback</a></strong>
        interface.</p>

    <p>This can be achieved by subclassing <code>org.flywaydb.core.api.callback.<strong>BaseFlywayCallback</strong></code>
    which already contains no-op implementations of all the methods of the <code>org.flywaydb.core.api.callback.<strong>FlywayCallback</strong></code>
    interface as well as access to a <strong>FlywayConfiguration</strong> class in the <strong>flywayConfiguration</strong>-field.</p>

    <p>If you decide to no use the provided base implementation, you can also implement the <strong><a
            href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/callback/FlywayCallback">FlywayCallback</a></strong>
        interface directly. In that case, to access the Flyway configuration your callback can implement <strong><a
            href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/configuration/ConfigurationAware"
    >ConfigurationAware</a></strong> and Flyway will automatically inject an instance of <strong><a
            href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/configuration/FlywayConfiguration"
    >FlywayConfiguration</a></strong>.</p>

    <h2>Custom Migration resolvers &amp; executors</h2>

    <p>For those that need more than what the SQL and Java-based migrations offer, you also have the possibility to
    implement your own <strong><a href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/resolver/MigrationResolver">MigrationResolver</a></strong>
        coupled with a custom <strong><a href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/resolver/MigrationExecutor">MigrationExecutor</a></strong>.
    </p>

    <p>These can then be used for loading things like CSV-based migrations or other custom formats.</p>

    <p>It is advised to subclass the provided <strong><a href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/resolver/BaseMigrationResolver">
        BaseMigrationResolver</a></strong> instead of implementing the interface directly, as this will allow amending
        the interface without breaking implementations.
    </p>

    <p>If you decide to no use the provided base implementation, you can also implement <strong><a
            href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/configuration/ConfigurationAware"
    >ConfigurationAware</a></strong> and Flyway will automatically inject an instance of <strong><a
            href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/configuration/FlywayConfiguration"
    >FlywayConfiguration</a></strong>.</p>

    <p>By using the <strong>skipDefaultResolvers</strong> property, these custom resolvers can also be used
    to completely replace the built-in ones (by default, custom resolvers will run in addition to
    built-in ones).</p>
