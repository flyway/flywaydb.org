# Mixed

## Description
Whether to allow mixing transactional and non-transactional statements within the same migration. Enabling this automatically causes the entire affected migration to be run without a transaction.

Note that this is only applicable for PostgreSQL, Aurora PostgreSQL, SQL Server and SQLite which all have statements that do not run at all within a transaction.

This is not to be confused with implicit transaction, as they occur in MySQL or Oracle, where even though a DDL statement was run within within a transaction, the database will issue an implicit commit before and after its execution.

## Default
false

./flyway -mixed="true" info
