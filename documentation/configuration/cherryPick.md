# Cherry Pick
{% include teams.html %}

## Description
A Comma separated list of migrations that Flyway should consider when migrating, undoing, or repairing. Leave blank to consider all discovered migrations.

Each item in the list must either be a valid migration version (e.g `2.1`) or a valid migration description (e.g. `create_table`).

For example:
- Create migrations `V1__create_table1.sql`, `V2__create_table2.sql`, and `R__create_view.sql`
- Run `flyway migrate -cherryPick="1,create_view"`

The schema history table now shows migration `V1` and `create_view` as being successfully applied. However `V2` has been skipped and is marked as 'ignored'. `V2__create_table2.sql` can be cherry picked for deployment at a later time.
