# Gradle Task: flywayMigrate

Migrates the schema to the latest version. Flyway will create the schema history table automatically if it doesn't
    exist.

            one was 2.0.0. But with the next release a new migration was added to version 1: 1.0.16. Such scenario is ignored
            by migrate command, but by default is rejected by validate. When ignoreIgnoredMigrations is enabled, such case
            will not be reported by validate command. This is useful for situations where one must be able to deliver
            complete set of migrations in a delivery package for multiple versions of the product, and allows for further
            development of older versions.

## Sample output

<pre class="console">> gradle flywayMigrate -i

## Important Note

When using Spring JDBC migrations, you must declare a dependency on `org.springframework:spring-jdbc:${springVersion}`
in Gradle's `buildScript` block to avoid being hit with a `java.lang.LinkageError`.
