    <h1>Code: Dev Environment Setup</h1>

    <p>To contribute to Flyway you will need to set up your development environment so that you can compile Flyway and
        run its test suite. </p>

    <p>For this you will need to set up Git, a JDK, Maven and your IDE.</p>

    <h2>Git</h2>

    <p>Flyway uses Git for version control. Download the latest version here: <a
            href="http://msysgit.github.com/"
            >http://msysgit.github.com/</a></p>

    <p>Make sure the directory containing the binaries has been added the PATH. If you downloaded an installer this
        should have been taken care of for you.</p>

    <h2>JDK</h2>

    <p>Flyway depends on JDK 6 or later. So grab the latest version here: <a
            href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>
    </p>

    <p>After the installation is complete</p>
    <ul>
        <li>set up an environment variable called JAVA_HOME that points to your JDK installation directory</li>
        <li>add the bin directory under JAVA_HOME to the PATH</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Maven</h2>

    <p>Flyway can be built with Maven 2 or 3. So grab the latest version here: <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html"
            >http://maven.apache.org/download.html</a>
    </p>

    <p>After the installation is complete</p>
    <ul>
        <li>set up an environment variable called M2_HOME that points to your Maven installation directory</li>
        <li>add the bin directory under M2_HOME to the PATH</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IDE</h2>

    <p>We use IntelliJ 12.1 for development. So grab the latest version here: <a
                href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/</a></p>

    <p>Eclipse should be fine too. However Eclipse has different
        defaults for code formatting and import reordering. Keep this in mind so merge conflicts can be reduced to a
        minimum.</p>
