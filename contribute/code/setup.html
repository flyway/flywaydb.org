    <h1>Code: Dev Environment Setup</h1>

    <p>To contribute to Flyway you will need to set up your development environment so that you can compile Flyway and
        run its test suite. </p>

    <p>For this you will need to set up Git, a JDK, Maven and your IDE.</p>

    <h2>Git</h2>

    <p>Flyway uses Git for version control. Download the latest version here: <a
            href="http://msysgit.github.com/"
            >http://msysgit.github.com/</a></p>

    <p>Make sure the directory containing the binaries has been added the PATH. If you downloaded an installer this
        should have been taken care of for you.</p>

    <h2>JDK</h2>

    <p>Even though at runtime Flyway depends on JDK 6 or later, it needs JDK 7 for building. So grab the latest version
        here: <a
                href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>
    </p>

    <p>After the installation is complete</p>
    <ul>
        <li>set up an environment variable called JAVA_HOME that points to your JDK installation directory</li>
        <li>add the bin directory under JAVA_HOME to the PATH</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Maven</h2>

    <p>Flyway can be built with Maven 2 or 3. So grab the latest version here: <a
            href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html"
            >http://maven.apache.org/download.html</a>
    </p>

    <p>After the installation is complete</p>
    <ul>
        <li>set up an environment variable called M2_HOME that points to your Maven installation directory</li>
        <li>add the bin directory under M2_HOME to the PATH</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IDE</h2>

    <p>We use IntelliJ for development. You can grab the latest version here: <a
            href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/</a></p>

    <p>Eclipse should be fine too. However Eclipse has different
        defaults for code formatting and import reordering. Keep this in mind so merge conflicts can be reduced to a
        minimum.</p>

    <h2>JREs</h2>

    <p>
        In order to build the platform-specific packages of the command-line tool, you need the JRE for each platform.
        Unfortunately these are not available through Maven Central and must be added manually to your local Maven
        repository.

    </p>

    <div class="well well-small">
        <strong>Tip:</strong>
        If your feature/bug fix doesn't impact the OS-specific part of the command-line tool
        and you do not wish to set up all the JREs, Flyway can be built using -P-CommandlinePlatformAssemblies<br/>
        This will skip the building of the OS-specific packages.

    <p>
        Download the following files from the <a
            href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle website</a>:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Windows x64 Server JRE 8u31</li>
        <li>Linux x64 Server JRE 8u31</li>
        <li>Mac OSX x64 JRE 8u31</li>
    </ul>

    <p>and place them in your local maven repository as</p>

    <ul>
        <li>~/.m2/repository/com/oracle/server-jre/8.31/server-jre-8.31-windows-x64.tar.gz</li>
        <li>~/.m2/repository/com/oracle/server-jre/8.31/server-jre-8.31-linux-x64.tar.gz</li>
        <li>~/.m2/repository/com/oracle/jre/8.31/jre-8.31-macosx-x64.tar.gz</li>
    </ul>
