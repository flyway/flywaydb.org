    <p>This guide is for people wishing to <strong>contribute code</strong> to Flyway.</p>

    <p>If you want to report an issue have a look at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flyway/issues/list">Issue
            Tracker</a> instead.</p>

    <h2>Set up your Dev Environment</h2>

    <div class="well well-small">
            <strong>Tip:</strong> If your feature/bug fix doesn&#x27;t
                impact the DB-specific code and you do not wish to set up all the databases, Flyway can be built using
                <strong>mvn clean install -P-MediumTests</strong>. This will
                disable all tests against the DBs.
    </div>

    <p>Congratulations! You now have a fully functional dev environment for Flyway. You can start contributing!</p>

    <h2>Raise an issue</h2>

    <p>The first step is to raise an issue in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flyway/issues/list">Issue
        Tracker</a>. This issue will be the place where you will be able to communicate with Flyway&#x27;s committers
        and other users. You can use it to present your ideas and gather feedback. </p>


    <h2>Fork the repository</h2>

    <p>The next step is to fork the <a href="https://github.com/flyway/flyway">GitHub repository</a>:<p>

    <h2>Write awesome code</h2>

    <p>Now is the time to work your magic and implement stuff! Commit your changes to your fork and don't forget to pull and
        merge the changes from the main repo as they happen.</p>

    <p>We use IntelliJ to develop Flyway. The <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/free_java_ide.html">free
        community edition</a> fits the bill perfectly. </p>

    <p>All source code is formatted using the default IntelliJ settings. </p>

    <h2>Publish your changes</h2>

    <p>Satisfied with your work? Great! Show the world! Create a <strong>pull request</strong> and briefly describe your changes:</p>

    <img src="/assets/img/pull-request.png" alt="Pull Request">

    <p>We'll have a look at them and provide you feedback until they're
        ready to be merged. If they are approved, we'll merge them in the mainline and include them in the next release!</p>

    <p><br/><br/><strong>Happy coding!</strong></p>
