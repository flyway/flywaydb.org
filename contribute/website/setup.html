    <h1>Website: Dev Environment Setup</h1>

    <p>To contribute to the Flyway website you will need to set up your development environment so that you run the
        website locally and submit changes. </p>

    <p>For this you will need to set up Git, Ruby, the Ruby Dev Kit, Jekyll and an editor.</p>

    <h2>Git</h2>

    <p>The Flyway website is developed using Git for version control, just like Flyway itself. Download the latest
        version here: <a
                href="http://msysgit.github.com/"
                >http://msysgit.github.com/</a></p>

    <p>Make sure the directory containing the binaries has been added the PATH. If you downloaded an installer this
        should have been taken care of for you.</p>

    <h2>Ruby</h2>

    <p>In order to install and run Jekyll you need a working Ruby installation.</p>

    <p>You can find the latest version of the RubyInstaller here:
        <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/</a>.</p>

    <p>Make sure the directory containing the binaries has been added the PATH. If you downloaded the installer this
        should have been taken care of for you.</p>

    <h2>Ruby Dev Kit</h2>

    <p>In order to install and run Jekyll you also need a Ruby Development Kit installation.</p>

    <p>Make sure to pick the version matching the Ruby version you just installed. You can find it here:
        <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/</a>.</p>

    <p>Unzip in a folder and then open a command-line prompt there to execute:</p>
    <pre class="console">&gt; ruby dk.rb init</pre>
    <p>followed by</p>
    <pre class="console">&gt; ruby dk.rb install</pre>

    <h2>Jekyll</h2>

    <p>To generate the static website from the Git repository we use Jekyll. You can install the latest version like
        this:</p>
    <pre class="console">&gt; gem install jekyll</pre>

    <h2>Editor</h2>

    <p>The website uses html files with Liquid headers for Jekyll. We personally use IntelliJ, which works quite well,
        but feel free to use any editor that suits you.</p>

    <h2>Done!</h2>

    <p>Congratulations! You now have a fully functional dev environment for the Flyway website. You can start
        contributing!</p>
