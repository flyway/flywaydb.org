    <h1>Website: Submit your Changes</h1>

    <h2>Raise an issue</h2>

    <p>The first step is to raise an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/flyway/flywaydb.org/issues">flywaydb.org
        Issue Tracker</a>. This issue will be the place where you will be able to communicate with Flyway&#x27;s
        committers and other users. You can use it to present your ideas and gather feedback. </p>


    <h2>Fork the repository</h2>

    <p>The next step is to fork the <a href="https://github.com/flyway/flywaydb.org">flywaydb.org GitHub repository</a>:
    </p>

    <h2>Write awesome docs</h2>

    <p>Now is the time to work your magic and write stuff! Commit your changes to your fork and don't forget to pull
        and merge the changes from the main repo as they happen.</p>

    <p>To view your changes locally you can execute this command in the root of your working copy:</p>
    <pre class="console">&gt; jekyll serve -w</pre>

    <h2>Publish your changes</h2>

    <p>Satisfied with your work? Great! Show the world! Create a <strong>pull request</strong> and briefly describe your
        changes:</p>

    Step 1: <br/>
    <img src="/contribute/code/pull-request.png" alt="Pull Request">
    <br/><br/><br/>
    Step 2: <br/>
    <img src="/contribute/code/pull-request2.png" alt="Pull Request2">

    <p>We'll have a look at them and provide you feedback until they're
        ready to be merged. If they are approved, we'll merge them in the mainline and include them in the next
        release!</p>

    <p><br/><br/><strong>Happy documenting!</strong></p>
